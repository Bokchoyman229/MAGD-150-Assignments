Assignment 1 https://github.com/Bokchoyman229/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/assignment1.pde 

The building project that just so happens to look like a person raising their arms.

Assignment 2 https://github.com/Bokchoyman229/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/assignment2.pde 

Assignment 2 was focusing on the vast infinate possiblities of space.

Assignment 3 https://github.com/Bokchoyman229/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/assignment3.pde 

For the screen saver project. I had infiniate spawning spheres that turned blue by when the mouse was clicked. Then reset the background to its original state when a key was pressed.

Assignment 4 https://github.com/Bokchoyman229/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/assignment4.pde 

Assignment 4 was a pizza theme, so I had circles of spheres pressed when the used clicked the mouse button. And had stacks of pepperioni created by moving the arrow keys and a square that would bounce across the screen.

Assignment 5 https://github.com/Bokchoyman229/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/assignment5.pde

This project was focused on the television. So I created 2 buttons next to the screen. One which would turn the screen off, and the other with would cause an error and project red. With font printed out "Lousey button!" When it's pressed.
